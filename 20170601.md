Attendees: Mike & Dusty

Sponsorships:
Funding tiers are easy to figure out (if we want a tiered structure):
- Platinum: $1,000
- Gold: $500
- Silver: $250
- Bronze: $100
- Meeting sponsor: $50

We never clearly outlined the specific benefits of each level (and nothing was decided). Maybe we don't need tiers--finding an annual sponsor(s) and meeting sponsors may be enough.

Post-event surveys:
We discussed the post-event follow-up. We can send post-event e-mail via Eventbrite which will go to everyone who registered (not just those that attended, so anyone who registered but didn't attend will still get the e-mail).
1. We need to use the Eventbrite mobile app to check people in when they attend (or check names off on the Guest List).
2. We need to collect all sign-in lists (e.g. Farm Bureau) following our events (or snap a photo of the list).
3. We need to manually add attendees in Eventbrite for those who attended but didn't register (so they'll get any follow-up e-mails).
4. We need to create a post event survey template, and use it following each event, i.e. we'll need to create a new survey for each monthly event.
5. We need some basic boilerplate for our follow-up e-mails.
6. We need to send a follow-up e-mail via Eventbrite, and include a link to the survey (whether SurveyMonkey, Google, etc.).

We don't need a follow-up e-mail for the June event, but we do need to figure out who's responsible for accomplishing the above (whether one person or several people).
