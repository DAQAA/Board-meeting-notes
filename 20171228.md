January Meeting - Wednesday, January 10, 2018
  - Mike will see if Gopi is available. If not Dusty had an idea for an open space type event. Annette could do some agile games or PowerPoint karaoke
  - Location: CCOP Training Center
  
Future meetings
  - everyone: be thinking about future sessions. Would be good to have a few planned out
  - Dusty will research possible sponsors, speakers, and grant information for March meeting, workshop, etc. We want to see if this is doable before we schedule Derek Swoboda's talk. James Bach and Angie Jones made our short list. If we can bring in a bigger name early in the year it can drive up attendance for the remainder of the year. We will potentially charge for this event
